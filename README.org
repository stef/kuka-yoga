* KUKA yoga

This KUKA Robot Language (KRL) program demoes how to control a KUKA robot from
an external source (like another computer or arduino) over a serial port, which
triggers an interrupt, additionally it contains a pseudo random number
generator.

The program makes a KR C2 sweep around touching 16 predefined points until it
receives a "1" on the 3rd serial port, then it switches to moving randomly
between 4 points always pointing in the same direction. Going back to the
sweeping around movement is done by sending a "0" on the serial port.

The serial port configuration is mostly irrelevant, the only important
detail is that it should be the same on both the KUKA and the other end.
